# Studies Weekly Coding Challenge - Article CMS
 A simple Content Management System (CMS) for educational articles. Create, read, update and delete articles from a database.

## Overview

Built using PHP Laravel for the backend and Vue 3 on the frontend, this project should demonstrate my ability to setup RESTful API endpoints where a user can perorm CRUD operations to interact   with and modify content in a MySQL database. 

## Setup
The following prerequisites are required for this project:
* MySQL: >= v8.0.31
* node: >= v16.17.1
* php: >= v8.1.10
* composer: >= v2.4.3

If there are issues with setup, please verify that you have these installed and that the version is up to date.
    
### Database Setup:

This project requires a MySQL database setup for storage of the Articles/Users. Set up a MySQL database by following the instructions [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/).

### Frontend Setup:

1. Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```
2. Create .env using .env.example file and include api endpoint.
   Laravel defaults to port 8000, but if you configured your backend to run on a different port, update this variable accordingly.
```
VITE_APP_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000/api
```
3. Start development server for the frontend
```
npm run dev
```
### Backend Setup:

1. Install Dependencies
```
composer install
```
2. Create .env file using .env.example in backend folder
update the database configuration so that it is configured to your MySQL Database.
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST={YOUR_HOST}
DB_PORT={YOUR_PORT}
DB_DATABASE={YOUR_DATABASE}
DB_USERNAME={YOUR_USERNAME}
DB_PASSWORD={YOUR_PASSWORD}
```
3. Migrate Database
```
php artisan migrate:fresh
```
4. Seed Database
```
php artisan db:seed
```
5. Start Laravel development server
```
php artisan serve
```
## Testing
For testing, the project uses a SQLite in-memory database and Laravel's built in testing structure to do feature tests on each of the API endpoints for the project.

To run tests: 
```
php artisan test
```

## App Functionallity
Interacting with the application should be pretty straight forward, the only view is a dashboard that displays all articles saved in the database. Here are some of the keypoints of the application:
1. **User Permissions**:
  Basic user permissions that will either allow or block access to interacting with the API. <br>
  There are 2 user types:<br>
  <br>**‚≠êAdmin Users** - have edit access and can create, delete, and update articles.  Admin users have a star by their name in the User dropdown. <br>
  <br>**Read Only Users** - Any user that doesn't have the star is a Non-Admin user, or Read-Only user. They can see and search all the articles, but will get blocked if they try to interact with the API.<br><br>
2. **Search by Title** üîé : <br>
The search bar in the dashboard allows you to search by title to find articles easier.

## API Routes Overview

This API provides various endpoints to interact with the application's resources. Below is a summary of the available routes and their basic functions:

### Users

- `GET /api/users`
  - Retrieve a list of all users.

- `POST /api/users`
  - Create a new user.

### Articles

- `GET /api/articles`
  - Retrieve a list of all articles.

- `GET /api/articles/{id}`
  - Retrieve details of a specific article.

- `POST /api/articles`
  - Create a new article.

- `PUT /api/articles/{id}`
  - Update information of a specific article.

- `DELETE /api/articles/{id}`
  - Delete an article.

Each route is designed to handle specific CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for corresponding resources.
